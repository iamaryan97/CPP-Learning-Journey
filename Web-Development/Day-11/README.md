# Day-11: HTML Basics 🌐

## 📌 Overview
This day marks the beginning of my Web Development journey.
I started learning HTML from scratch and created my first basic web page.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- What HTML is and why it is used
- Basic structure of an HTML document
- Common HTML tags:
  - Headings (`h1`, `h2`)
  - Paragraphs (`p`)
  - Lists (`ul`, `ol`, `li`)
  - Links (`a`)
- How to open an HTML file in a browser

## 📂 Files in this Folder
- `index.html` → My first HTML webpage

## 🎯 Outcome
Successfully created and displayed my first static webpage using HTML.
This laid the foundation for learning CSS and JavaScript next.
