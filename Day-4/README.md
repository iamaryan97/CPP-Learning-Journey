# Day-4 Progress 🚀

## 🔥 Concepts Learned
- Introduction to Arrays
- Declaring and using arrays
- Taking array input from the user
- Traversing arrays using loops
- Basic array operations:
  - Finding maximum element
  - Summing array elements
  - Counting even numbers
  - Reversing an array

## 📂 Programs Completed

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `array_input_output.cpp` | Takes `n` elements as input and prints them |
| `array_max.cpp` | Finds the maximum value in the array |
| `array_sum.cpp` | Calculates the sum of all array elements |
| `even_count.cpp` | Counts how many even numbers are present in the array |
| `reverse_array.cpp` | Prints the array elements in reverse order |

## 🧠 Learning Outcome
- Learned how arrays help store multiple values efficiently  
- Improved logic using loops + arrays  
- Learned how to perform basic operations that are used in DSA  
- Prepared for advanced topics like searching and sorting
