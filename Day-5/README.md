# Day-5 Progress 🚀

## 🔥 Concepts Learned
Today I learned two of the most important searching algorithms used in Data Structures and coding interviews:

### 1️⃣ Linear Search
- Searches each element one by one.
- Works on **unsorted** arrays.
- Simple but slower for large data.

### 2️⃣ Binary Search
- Works only on **sorted arrays**.
- Splits the array in half again and again.
- Much faster and used in real-world applications.

## 📂 Programs Completed

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `linear_search.cpp` | Searches for a given key using Linear Search and returns index if found |
| `binary_search.cpp` | Implements Binary Search for fast searching in sorted arrays |

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome
- Understood how searching works internally
- Able to compare time efficiency of linear vs binary search
- Gained confidence in writing logic with conditions + loops
- Prepared for next topic: **Sorting Algorithms**
