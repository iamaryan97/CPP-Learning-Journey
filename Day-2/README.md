# Day-2 Progress 🚀

## 🔥 Concepts Learned
- If-Else statements
- For Loop and While Loop
- Logical condition checking
- Pattern printing using nested loops

## 📂 Programs Completed
| File Name | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `one_to_twenty.cpp` | Prints numbers from 1 to 20 |
| `sum_1_to_n.cpp` | Inputs a number `n` and prints sum from 1 to n |
| `even_1_to_100.cpp` | Prints even numbers from 1 to 100 |
| `factorial.cpp` | Calculates factorial of a number |
| `age_check.cpp` | Checks if user is Minor or Adult |
| `patterns.cpp` | Prints multiple star patterns using nested loops |

## 🧠 Learning Outcome
- Looping logic became stronger
- Better understanding of condition based programming
- Ability to create shapes and UI-like patterns
